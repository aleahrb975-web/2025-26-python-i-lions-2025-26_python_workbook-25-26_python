program should compute and display the area of the room.

Exercise 5:  Bottle Deposits
In many jurisdictions a small deposit is added to drink

more than one liter have $0.25 deposit.
Write a program that reads the number of containers of each 
size from the user.  Your program should continue by computing 
and displaying the refund that will be received for returning 
those containers.  Format the output so that it includes a dollar
